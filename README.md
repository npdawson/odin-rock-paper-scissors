The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors project

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a first Javascript program.

## What I learned
- Getting accustomed to Javascript syntax
- Explored some string methods in order to test for a substring
    1 match - takes a regex and returns an array of matching substrings
    2 search - takes a string or regex and returns the index of the first match (-1 if no match found)
